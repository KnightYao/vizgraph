# Usage

The major framework is based on Electron, so it should be worked on Windows, Mac and Linux.

## For Developers

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/jcf94/vizgraph.git

$ cd vizgraph

$ npm install

$ npm start
```

Then start playing it.

Use [electron-builder](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder) to pack release for platforms you like.

## For Users

Get the latest [release](https://github.com/jcf94/vizgraph/releases). Unzip and it's tiny but useful.

Sorry for only pack for Windows now.
